## Project Overview

593 semester project: creating a distributed MPC system with data policy enforcement

# How it works

- Split any integer secret into `n` shares.
- Each share (except the last) is a random integer, possibly positive or negative.
- The sum of all shares equals the original secret (last share is calculated based on the previous randomly generated ones).
- Reconstruct the original secret by summing the shares.

# Secret Sharing in Rust

The secret share function splits a secret integer into multiple "shares" so that the sum of all shares is a reconstructed version of the original secret. This is a basic illustration of how secret splitting works for secure multi-party computation (MPC).

## Script Details

| Script Name | Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`client.rs`** | **client nodes** | The entry point. Calls all other scripts in the correct order (ETL → Logic → Analysis → Viz). |
| **`server3333/3334.rs`** | **server in distributed system** | Ingests `01_raw` CSVs, cleans headers/dates, and builds the `usaspending.db`. |

Both server files function the same, each has its own local host and txt file location hardcoded internally. 

## How to Run Program


### System Requirements

  * updated version of Rust
  * hello_cargo will handle other dependencies

### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment
