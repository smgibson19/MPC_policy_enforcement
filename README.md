## Script Details

| Script Name | Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`client.rs`** | **client nodes** | intake num to share and policy, splits between servers |
| **`server3333/3334.rs`** | **server in distributed system** | sums shares from clients, calls policy to send data who has permission |

- Both server files function the same, each has its own local host and txt file location hardcoded internally. 

## How to Run Program

### System Requirements

  * updated version of Rust
  * hello_cargo contains necessary rust dependencies
  * recommend using a linux commandline

### Running the System

command to run: cargo run --bin `filename` `list` `args`

1) Open each server instance in a seperate commandline
    -  make sure both servers are running before clients are called
2) Open three instances of the client file
    - input syntax for arguments is as follows: number file.txt file2.txt
    - for what is implemented in this project, server1.txt and server2.txt are the files necessary for clients to give access to complete the sum
    - additional clients can be added, number of clients can be modified by the `num_parties` variable
